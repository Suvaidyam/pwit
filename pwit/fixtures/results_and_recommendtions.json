  "description": "Multiyear partnerships nurture trust as relationships between funders and nonprofits deepen over time and a mutual understanding of both stakeholders’ needs is built. Engaging in longer-term partnerships allows funders to move from being only grantmakers to playing the role of advisors. A multiyear approach can help to increase focus on creating lasting change over immediate and short-term outputs. Additionally, it enables stability for nonprofits to plan for the future.\n\nFor funders, multiyear partnerships also simplify grantmaking, reducing the time spent on scouting new nonprofit partners and projects and helping funders gain a deeper understanding of social issues. Partnerships can enrich programme team members, who are able to invest more time and effort in understanding a nonprofit’s needs and support the nonprofit in delivering on its intended impact. Here’s where your organisation ranks on several dimensions of multiyear partnerships.",
