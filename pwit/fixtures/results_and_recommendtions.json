  "description": "Multiyear partnerships simplify grantmaking, reduce the time spent on scouting new grantees and projects, and help funders gain a deeper understanding of social issues. Engaging in these longer-term partnerships allows funders to move from being only grant makers to playing the role of advisors to nonprofit partners and can facilitate greater job enrichment for program teams as they are able to invest more time and effort in understanding nonprofit needs and support them in delivering on their intended impact. Multiyear partnerships nurture trust as relationships between funders and nonprofits deepen over time and a mutual understanding of a nonprofit’s needs and goals grows. For funders, adopting a multiyear approach can help increasingly focus on creating lasting change, over immediate and short-term outputs. Additionally, it enables stability and visibility for nonprofits to plan and direct efforts on their core focus.",
